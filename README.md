# st-ream
A custom music streaming app for Android.
I started to download music and "rip" CDs to build an offline library. But I could only listen to it using my laptop.
So I thought about building something to stream music from a central server to my phone as well.
I got to a "it works" point, with a very minimal backend in Rust (*back* branch) and a very rudimentary app.

Then I lost interest, both because I started using my phone less for music and because my usual drive is "is it possible?", so once I arrived at an MVP that wasn't a factor anymore.

### PS
The above would have been the original README if I actually had put a little effort into this.
As things go, I'm not even using Android anymore, so I *may* give another shot to a st-ream project but with another focus and platform in mind.
For the record, I did not ditch Android for iOS but for UBTouch.
